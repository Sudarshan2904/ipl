  <p style="font-family: 'Zilla Slab', serif; font-size: 21px;">The <b>Indian Premiere League</b> (<b>IPL</b>) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008. The IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours Programme.
  </p>
  <b> <span class="mw-headline" id="Prize_money">Foundation</span> </b>
  <p style="font-family: 'Zilla Slab', serif; font-size: 21px;">On 13 September 2007, the BCCI announced the launch of a franchise-basedTwenty20 cricket competition called Indian Premier League whose first season was slated to start in April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" inNew Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, said to be the mastermind behind the idea of the IPL, spelled out the details of the tournament including its format, the prize money, franchise revenue system and squad composition rules. It was also revealed that the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India players and BCCI officials and that the top two teams of the IPL would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20. Modi also clarified that they had been working on the idea for two years and that the IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL. The league's format was similar to that of the Premier League of England and the NBA in the United States.
  </p>

 <b> <span class="mw-headline" id="Prize_money">Prize Money</span> </b>
  <p style="font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif; font-size: 21px;">The 2019 season of the IPL offered a total prize money of <span class="nowrap"><span style="white-space: nowrap">₹</span>500 million</span> (US$7.0&nbsp;million), with the winning team netting <span class="nowrap"><span style="white-space: nowrap">₹</span>200 million</span> (US$2.8&nbsp;million). The first and second runners up received <span class="nowrap"><span style="white-space: nowrap">₹</span>125 million</span> (US$1.8&nbsp;million) and <span class="nowrap"><span style="white-space: nowrap">₹</span>87.5 million</span> (US$1.2&nbsp;million), respectively, with the fourth placed team also winning <span class="nowrap"><span style="white-space: nowrap">₹</span>87.5 million</span> (US$1.2&nbsp;million). The other teams are not awarded any prize money. The IPL rules mandate that half of the prize money must be distributed among the players.
  </p>


<b> <span class="mw-headline" id="Prize_money">Tournament Format</span> </b>
  <p style="font-family: 'Zilla Slab', serif; font-size: 21px;">Currently, with eight teams, each team plays each other twice in a home-and-away round-robin format in the league phase. At the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams from the league phase will play against each other in the first Qualifying match, with the winner going straight to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance to qualify for the IPL final by playing the second Qualifying match. Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase play against each other in an eliminator match and the winner from that match will play the loser from the first Qualifying match. The winner of the second Qualifying match will move onto the final to play the winner of the first Qualifying match in the IPL Final match, where the winner will be crowned the Indian Premier League champions.
